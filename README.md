*Project 5: Make Your App Material (Project 5 of Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree)*

redesign an app to follow the Material Design guidelines and translate a set of static design mocks to a living and breathing app.

 - App uses the Design Support library and its provided widget types (FloatingActionButton, AppBarLayout, SnackBar, etc).
 - App uses CoordinatorLayout for the main activity.
 - App theme extends from AppCompat.
 - App uses an app bar and associated toolbars.
 - App provides a Floating Action Button (FAB) for the most common action(s).
 - App properly specifies elevations for app bars, FABs, and other elements specified in the Material Design specification.
 - App provides sufficient space between text and surrounding elements.
 - App has a consistent color theme defined in styles.xml.
 - Color theme does not impact usability of the app.
 - App uses images that are high quality, specific, and full bleed.
 - App uses fonts that are either the Android defaults, are complementary, and aren't otherwise distracting.
 - App conforms to common standards found in the Android Nanodegree General Project Guidelines
